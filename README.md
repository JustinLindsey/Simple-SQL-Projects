# Simple-SQL-Projects
In here I have different projects that show my familiarity with SQL. I have data cleaning and validation, as well as queries for analyzation that links to vizualizations on Tableau.

### Covid SQL Project
For this first project. I took a data set that displayed data related to Covid. This included data about vaccinations, cases, location, mortality rate, and so much more! The dataset is huge, and I could've easily spent another month analyzing it, but I wanted to primarily focus on the mortality rate, location, and vaccinations to see how they all correlated. I have both the [dataset used](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths) as well as the link to the [tableau visualization](shorturl.at/aeG09) related to my project.
