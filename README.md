# Simple-SQL-Projects
In here I have different projects that show my familiarity with SQL. I have data cleaning and validation, as well as queries for analyzation that links to vizualizations on Tableau.

### Covid SQL Project
For this first project. I took a data set that displayed data related to Covid. This included data about vaccinations, cases, location, mortality rate, and so much more! The dataset is huge, and I could've easily spent another month analyzing it, but I wanted to primarily focus on the mortality rate, location, and vaccinations to see how they all correlated. I have both the [dataset used](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths) as well as the link to the [tableau visualization](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/justin.lindsey/viz/CovidProjectDashboard_16626912379570/Dashboard1) related to my project.

### Data Cleaning Project
With this project it was all about practicing my skills with data cleaning. I seperated and added new columns, searched for null values, etc. Basically anything I could do that would make the data better suited to be analyzed later on! This was a fictional dataset, but if you would like to download the Excel file [click here](https://github.com/AlexTheAnalyst/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/Nashville%20Housing%20Data%20for%20Data%20Cleaning.xlsx?raw=true)!
